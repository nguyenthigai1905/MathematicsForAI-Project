# MathematicsForAI-Report
**This is our group's Google PageRank report in the course of Mathematics for artificial intelligence.**
Today, search engines like Google or Bing work by searching and retrieving information from billions of web pages on the Internet and providing relevant results to users. To do this, they use search algorithms, a set of rules and processes to determine and sort search results. Among them is the search algorithm of the Internet search engine Google - born in 1997. That algorithm has played a key role in making Google the leading tool in the search war. That algorithm, named PageRank, was introduced in a 1998 paper by Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford University. In this report, we will learn about how the Google PageRank algorithm works.

## About the report
- Web graph and Pagerank algorithm
- Matrix application in Pagerank.
- Contact with Markov chain theory to provide solutions for special cases. In this part, we have implemented the algorithm using Python.
